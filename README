Currently this bot includes only the search feature. You can search for any query and it gives out the top tweets about that query.

Work to be done.
1. Search - Improve searching by adding more parameters.
2. Trend - List down all the trending topics (and its improvisation like location-wise, daily, and weekly)
3. Users - Just return the basic user information.
4. Improvisation - Include OAuth and other operations.
